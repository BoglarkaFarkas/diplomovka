## Overview

As part of this thesis, a Dockerized web application was developed. The purpose of this application is to assist teachers in correcting math exams more efficiently.

The platform allows users (typically teachers) to save the correct results of individual math problems. This makes it easier to evaluate student submissions later. The user has the possibility to evaluate individual test tasks, which are mathematical problems, through the website.

To use the system, the user must upload an image of the student's solution. The system then compares the extracted result with the correct answer stored in the database.

The application is limited to mathematical problems whose solutions are either positive or negative integers.

## Input Format Example

To ensure correct evaluation, the structure of the exams must follow a specific format. Below is an example of a valid input format:
